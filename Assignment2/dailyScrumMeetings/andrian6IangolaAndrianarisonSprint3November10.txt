a) What did I work on in the last three days?
   - Review crcCards and made appropriate changes
   - Fixed bugs in MakeDirectory and List classes so they donâ€™t crash
     the program and do what they need to do
   - Fixed PopDirectory method calling in JShellExcecute and fixed the
     class so it works properly

b) What do I plan to work in the next three days?

c) Am I blocked on anything?
